## This Business Card Thing

This is a quick project that demonstrates key ideas of HTML and CSS that I've been slowly learning over the past few days. I've deployed it using netlify (link in title).

Personally, the highlight of this challenge was playing with the keyframes! I'm really starting to enjoy playing with css, and I saw a lot of cool ideas using tailwind so hopefully I will get more into the tailwind framework as I progress.

If this template looks familiar, that is because I am learning HTML/CSS using scrimba. My next goal is to learn javascript and then eventually react! 

Also, I know this project isn't good enough to go on GitHub, but I'm working on learning how to use GitHub as well so I thought I would get some practice in :D.
